# Rock-vs-Mine-prediction

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing sonar data and building a classification model to predict whether an object detected underwater is a rock or a mine using Logistic Regression.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided in a CSV format. It consists of sonar readings represented by a set of features (60 in total) and corresponding labels indicating whether the detected object is a rock (R) or a mine (M).

## Pre-requisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn (for logistic regression model and metrics)

## WorkFlow
![workflow](https://github.com/BhaskarKulshrestha/Rock-vs-Mine-prediction/assets/95305804/31dc29cd-c003-4773-aefa-b7e666004343)
## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Python script `sonar_classification.py`.
3. The script will load the dataset, perform data analysis, train a logistic regression model, and make predictions.
4. You can also input custom data to get predictions for new instances.

## Files
- `sonar_classification.py`: Main Python script containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `Copy of sonar data.csv`: Dataset containing sonar readings and labels.

## Lesson Learned
- **Understanding and preprocessing the data:** It's crucial to explore the dataset thoroughly, handle missing values (if any), and preprocess the features appropriately for better model performance.
- **Model training and evaluation:** Choosing an appropriate algorithm and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy are essential steps in machine learning.
- **Interpretation of results:** Interpreting the predictions and understanding the model's decisions are vital for real-world applications.

## Future Scope
- **Experiment with other machine learning algorithms:** Apart from logistic regression, exploring other algorithms like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks could potentially improve the model's performance.
- **Feature engineering:** Experiment with feature selection techniques or engineer new features to enhance the model's predictive power.
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters could lead to better performance and generalization.
- **Deployment:** Once satisfied with the model's performance, consider deploying it in real-world applications, such as underwater robotics or surveillance systems.
